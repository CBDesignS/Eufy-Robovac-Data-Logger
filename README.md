A Home Assistant custom component for comprehensive Eufy Robovac API debugging with **Enhanced Smart Investigation Mode v3.0** for accessory wear detection research.

## 🎯 What This Integration Does

This integration is specifically designed for **debugging and research** of Eufy robovac API data, with advanced features for discovering accessory sensor byte positions:

### 🔍 Enhanced Smart Investigation Mode v3.0
- **Complete Key 180 Analysis**: Byte-by-byte payload examination with sensors config integration
- **Self-Contained Files**: Every analysis file includes complete Android app reference data
- **Smart Change Detection**: Only logs meaningful changes, reducing file bloat by 80-90%
- **Position Discovery**: Automated analysis to find correct accessory sensor byte positions
- **Before/After Cleaning**: Capture baseline and post-cleaning data for wear detection

### 🌐 RestConnect Technology
- **Advanced REST API Client**: Access to multiple Eufy API endpoints
- **Smart Fallback**: Automatic fallback to basic login if REST endpoints fail
- **Enhanced Data Collection**: Combines traditional DPS data with REST endpoint data
- **Multiple Data Sources**: Device, accessory, consumable, and runtime APIs

### 📊 Proven Data Sources
- **Key 163**: Battery level (100% accuracy from NEW Android app)
- **Key 167**: Water tank level with enhanced byte analysis
- **Key 180**: Complete accessory wear data with smart investigation
- **Keys 181-190**: Enhanced data from RestConnect endpoints

## 🔬 Investigation Mode Discoveries

### ✅ Confirmed Findings
Through Enhanced Smart Investigation Mode v3.0, we've achieved:

- **Position 15 = Brush Guard (97%)**: Exact match confirmed through investigation files
- **Self-Contained Analysis**: Complete Android app percentages included in every log file
- **Smart Efficiency**: 80-90% reduction in duplicate files while capturing all meaningful changes
- **Template System**: Clean sensors.json inheritance with real Android app data

### 🎯 Current Investigation Status
```json
{
  "investigation_mode": "Enhanced Smart v3.0",
  "baseline_captured": true,
  "position_15_analysis": "97% = Brush Guard (EXACT MATCH)",
  "next_step": "Run cleaning cycle to verify Position 15 decreases",
  "efficiency": "80-90% file reduction with complete data"
}
```

### 📁 Investigation Files
All files are saved to: `/config/eufy_investigation/DEVICE_ID/`
- `key180_baseline_TIMESTAMP.json` - Pre-cleaning baseline with sensors config
- `key180_post_cleaning_TIMESTAMP.json` - Post-cleaning analysis  
- `enhanced_session_summary_SESSION_ID.json` - Complete session analysis

## 🧠 Smart Features

### Enhanced Investigation Workflow
1. **Baseline Capture**: Record Key 180 data before cleaning with complete sensors reference
2. **Cleaning Cycle**: Run 5-10 minute cleaning cycle
3. **Post-Cleaning Analysis**: Capture data after docking with change detection
4. **Byte Position Discovery**: Automated analysis finds correct accessory positions
5. **Confirmation Testing**: Verify positions decrease logically after cleaning

### Self-Contained Analysis Files
Every investigation file now includes:
- ✅ Complete Android app percentages for comparison
- ✅ Current sensors configuration for reference
- ✅ Position analysis with confidence scoring
- ✅ Investigation workflow instructions
- ✅ Complete audit trail with metadata

## 📊 Current Sensors & Accuracy

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

This integration builds upon outstanding work from the Eufy community:

- **[jeppesens](https://github.com/jeppesens/eufy-clean)** - For cleaning up Login, Authentication, and Device ID handling. His refined codebase provided the solid foundation for this RestConnect implementation.

- **[Martijnpoppen](https://github.com/martijnpoppen/eufy-clean)** - For the original reverse engineering work that made all this possible. Without his initial research, none of this would exist.

This Enhanced Smart Investigation Edition represents the culmination of community research with advanced debugging capabilities for accessory wear detection.
