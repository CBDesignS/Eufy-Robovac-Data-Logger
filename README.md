A Home Assistant custom component for comprehensive Eufy Robovac API debugging with **Enhanced Smart Investigation Mode v4.0** for accessory wear detection research.

## 🎯 What This Integration Does

This integration is specifically designed for **debugging and research** of Eufy robovac API data, with advanced features for discovering accessory sensor byte positions:

### 🔍 Enhanced Smart Investigation Mode v4.0
- **Complete Key Data Analysis**: Byte-by-byte payload examination with sensors config integration
- **Self-Contained Files**: Every analysis file includes complete Android app reference data
- **Smart Change Detection**: Only logs meaningful changes, reducing file bloat by 80-90%
- **Position Discovery**: Automated analysis to find correct accessory sensor byte positions
- **Before/After Cleaning**: Capture baseline and post-cleaning data for wear detection

### 🌐 RestConnect Technology
- **these have been removed for the momemt as the endpoint servers are either not online or when they are there is no data being transmitted. (Eufy must still be testing the backend servers)

### 📊 Proven Data Sources
- **Key 163**: Battery level (100% accuracy from NEW Android app)
- **Key 167**: possible Water tank level with enhanced byte analysis
- **Key 180**: Complete accessory wear data with smart investigation
- **Keys 181-190**: Enhanced data from RestConnect endpoints (again who knows whats in here at the moment, it could be dps data or rest data. only logging and investigation will enlighten us)

## 🔬 Investigation Mode Discoveries

### ✅ Confirmed Findings
Through Enhanced Smart Investigation Mode v3.0, we've achieved:

- **Position 15 = Brush Guard (97%)**: Exact match confirmed through investigation files but still needs further testing to be completed.
- **Self-Contained Analysis**: Complete Android app percentages included in every log file. (You must update /accessorys/sensors.json with your real world accessory usage data from the mobile app)
- **Smart Efficiency**: 80-90% reduction in duplicate files while capturing all meaningful changes
- **Template System**: Clean sensors.json inheritance with real Android app data but you must have, and keep the file updated with your real world accessory wear data

### 🎯 Current Investigation Status
```json
{
  "investigation_mode": "Enhanced Smart v4.0",
  "baseline_captured": true,
  "position_15_analysis": "97% = Brush Guard (EXACT MATCH)",
  "next_step": "Run cleaning cycle to verify Position 15 decreases",
  "efficiency": "80-90% file reduction with complete data"
}
```

### 📁 Investigation Files
All files are saved to: `/config/eufy_investigation/DEVICE_ID/`
- `key180_baseline_TIMESTAMP.json` - Pre-cleaning baseline with sensors config
- `key180_post_cleaning_TIMESTAMP.json` - Post-cleaning analysis  
- `enhanced_session_summary_SESSION_ID.json` - Complete session analysis

## 🧠 Smart Features

### Enhanced Investigation Workflow
1. **Baseline Capture**: Record All Key data before cleaning with complete sensors reference
2. **Cleaning Cycle**: Run 5-10 minute cleaning cycle
3. **Post-Cleaning Analysis**: Capture data after docking with change detection
4. **Byte Position Discovery**: Automated analysis finds correct accessory positions
5. **Confirmation Testing**: Verify positions decrease logically after cleaning

### Self-Contained Analysis Files
Every investigation file now includes:
- ✅ Complete Android app percentages for comparison
- ✅ Current sensors configuration for reference
- ✅ Position analysis with confidence scoring
- ✅ Investigation workflow instructions
- ✅ Complete audit trail with metadata

## 📊 Current Sensors & Accuracy

 Example of a real world test setup and logging..
 
| Sensor | Android App | Investigation Status | Accuracy |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|----------|
| Battery (Key 163) | N/A | ✅ Confirmed | 100% |
| Brush Guard | 97% | 🎯 Position 15 (EXACT MATCH) | Pending cleaning test |
| Rolling Brush | 99% | 🔍 Multiple candidates found | Under investigation |
| Side Brush | 98% | 🔍 Multiple candidates found | Under investigation |
| Dust Filter | 99% | 🔍 Multiple candidates found | Under investigation |
| Water Tank | 76% | 🔍 Multiple candidates found | Under investigation |

- **Fallback System**: Never fails - automatically switches to basic login
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Combines traditional and REST data sources

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

This integration builds upon outstanding work from the Eufy community:

- **[jeppesens](https://github.com/jeppesens/eufy-clean)** - For cleaning up Login, Authentication, and Device ID handling. His refined codebase provided the solid foundation for this RestConnect implementation.

- **[Martijnpoppen](https://github.com/martijnpoppen/eufy-clean)** - For the original reverse engineering work that made all this possible. Without his initial research, none of this would exist.

This Enhanced Smart Investigation Edition represents the culmination of community research with advanced debugging capabilities for accessory wear detection.
